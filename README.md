# PowershellScripts
Just a bunch of the powershell scripts i've made for work. They are not perfect, but tend to get the job done.

Please feel free to update or improve the scripts, most/all of them were designed to be run from Powershell ISE or as an automated/scheduled task... a simple pause/prompt user input would fix most of that. 

This is not the best solution or the only solution. This was just mine.
