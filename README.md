# PowershellScripts
Please note*** These scripts were written for Powershell 6 and have not been tested in Powershell 7.

Just a bunch of the powershell scripts i've made for work. They are not perfect, but tend to get the job done.

I hope that this can offer some help to one or more of you, either as a whole, or as snippets. I know I spent many hours trying to find snippets only to code it myself and recode it many times over.

Please feel free to update or improve the scripts, most/all of them were designed to be run from Powershell ISE or as an automated/scheduled task... a simple pause/prompt user input would fix most of that. 

This is not the best solution or the only solution. This was just mine.
